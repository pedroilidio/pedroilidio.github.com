<h1 id="intuitive-eolr-with-two-misoriented-edges">Intuitive EOLR with
two misoriented edges</h1>
<p>A comprehensive guide by Pedro Ilídio.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Like many enthusiasts, I believe Roux has the potential to surpass
CFOP as the main speedcubing method around, given its naturally lower
move count. And for this potential to be fully explored and optimal
times to be achieved with Roux, one of the essentialities is to employ
optimizations of the last six edges (LSE) step, such as EOLR, increasing
the move efficiency as much as possible but avoiding an expressive
recognition burden.</p>
<p>Despite Roux being advertised as an intuitive solving method, the
learning of EOLR still usually involves memorizing and recognizing a
bunch of specific cases and sequences of moves, even if parts of these
sequences are commonly regarded as intuitive.</p>
<p>In this document, I present some ideas to improve EOLR intuitiveness
that I have been experimenting with for a few months. Specifically, a
general algorithm is proposed to obtain a “good arrow” from any of the
LSE states with only two misoriented edges (2mo). Since a 2mo or 4mo
state appears in 15 out of 16 times (93.75% probability), having
intuitive solutions to these two states is of great relevance to one’s
performance. Although finding a good arrow from 4mo in general is
already pretty intuitive, new ideas for tackling 2mo are
appreciated.</p>
<p>I do not expect the present procedure to be a replacement for the
current recognition methods of experienced solvers, but I do hope
to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Facilitate EOLR learning for newer Roux users, that still have
limited to none experience with EOLR;</li>
<li>Promote development of new LSE recognition techniques, proposing a
framework of thought to be expanded by the community. Hopefully a humble
step towards fully intuitive one-look LSE.</li>
</ol>
<p>No EOLR knowledge is needed, but we require the reader to be familiar
with Rubik's cube notation and the Roux method.</p>
<p>A throughout introduction to basic concepts of edge orientation in
Roux’s last six edges (LSE) step is firstly presented in Section 2,
aimed at describing the process of thought that originated these ideas
and building the conceptual foundation for the final proposed algorithm,
summarized at the end (Section TL;DR). An introduction to EOLR is then
provided (Section 3), contextualizing EOLR in the framework described in
the first setions followed by several case examples with links to 3D
visualizations (Example solves appendix) and a final discussion of
current limitations of the technique and open paths for future thoughts
(Section 5).</p>

<h2 id="edge-orientation-principles">2. Edge orientation principles</h2>
<p>Consider the much more simple setting of six light bulbs that can be
either turned on or turned off. They start all turned off, and your goal
is to light them all up. However, you are required to do so by an
arbitrary number of steps in which, for each step, you select four lamps
and toggle their switch, so that those which are turned on become turned
off and vice-versa. The solution one would probably come up with is
pretty straightforward: just turn 4 of the lights on, then select 3
lights on and 1 off to toggle, after which you end up with 4 lights off
that you can just turn on in one last step (Figure 1).</p>
<p><img src="/images/light_bulbs.svg" width="600" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Simple light bulb analogy to LSE.</p>
<p>The LSE-4a step of the Roux method is not that different from that
simple analogy. In this step, each of the six edges can be either
oriented or misoriented.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> We say an edge is
<strong>oriented</strong> if its U or D sticker (here represented as
white or yellow, as many cubers choose it to be) faces up or down when
the U or the D center is placed up or down (Figure 2).</p>
<p><img src="/images/eo1.svg" width="200" /> <img src="/images/eo2.svg"
width="200" /> <img src="/images/eo3.svg" width="200" /> <img
src="/images/eo4.svg" width="200" /> <img src="/images/eo5.svg"
width="200" /> <img src="/images/eo6.svg" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Examples of LSE states with labels
indicating the oriented (o) and misoriented (mo) edges.</p>
<p><strong>Whenever a U turn is made around an F or B center (green or
blue in the diagrams), the four edge pieces surrounding it switch
orientation</strong>, so that oriented edges become misoriented and
vice-versa (Figure 3). Since there are 6 edges remaining and we can only
toggle orientation of four edges at a time, there can only be 2, 4 or 6
misoriented edges in total.</p>
<p><img src="/images/eo_toggle.svg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Illustration of edge orientation toggling.
When a U or U’ move is made with an F or B center on top, the four edges
around it flip their orientatons, so that the oriented edges become
misoriented and the misoriented become oriented.)</p>
<p>So the way we solve the orientation of the LSE necessarily involves a
last stage where 4 remaining misoriented edges are oriented by a U or U’
move around a B or F center (similarly to the light bulbs analogy).</p>
<p>Notice that two consecutive turns (a U2 move) cancel each other out,
having no effect in edge orientation.</p>
<p>The possible adjustments of the edges’ positions that do not change
their orientation: 1. U or U’ can be arbitrarily performed if a white or
yellow center is on top. 2. One can arbitrarily raise a red/orange
center and do U2.</p>
<p>Since we usually recognize cases with white or yellow on top, it is
useful to, in one of these states, consider beforehand the set of pieces
that would be around the F or B centers if F or B is placed in the top
layer. For the F center, this group of edges corresponds to the edges in
the positions UF, UL, UR and DF. I will thereafter refer to this set of
pieces as the <strong>F-cycle</strong> (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Analogously, I will call by <strong>B-cycle</strong> the edges at UB,
UL, UR and DB collectively. Again, these cycles correspond to the pieces
that will end up on top around the F center when an M’ move is performed
(in the case of the F-cycle), or around the B center when an M move is
executed (for the B-cycle). When the respective center (F or B) is on
top, performing a U or U’ move will switch the orientation of the 4
edges of the corresponding cycle, besides shifting their position as
shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> We collectively call by
<strong>F-cycle</strong> the edge positions UF, UR, DF and UL, and by
<strong>B-cycle</strong> the edge positions UB, UL, DB and UR.</p>
<p><img src="/images/f_cycle.svg" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> F-cycle representation. If M'UM is
performed, "turning the F-cycle clockwise", the four highlighted edges
will toggle orientation and be permuted as indicated by the arrows.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cycles correspond, in the simpler light bulb analogy,
to the two possible sets of 4 lights that we can toggle together, and
the last step of edge orientation also involves selecting 4 lamps off
(misoriented edges) to turn on, corresponding to the usually called
“arrow” configuration, where all edges of a cycle and only them are
misoriented.</p>
<p>A difference here is that edges can be repositioned with arbitrary U
moves around a white/yellow (U/D) center or U2 around  an F/B center,
without changing their orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> I refer to performing M’ followed by U
or U’ and then M or M’ as <strong>turning the F-cycle</strong>, and to
making an M move followed by U or U’ and then by M or M’ as
<strong>turning the B-cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>These optional turning directions will later be restricted by
EOLR.</p>
<p>So the procedure to orient all LSE using only M and U moves
(footprint: usual EOLR algorithms may involve R or r moves in the 4mo
state, not considered here.) is strikingly similar to Figure 1. Starting
from a state where all 6 edges are misoriented (what I will call the
<strong>6mo state</strong>), follow Procedure 1.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 1: orienting all the last six edges from the 6mo
state.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Switch 4mo edges.</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>Turn the F- or B-cycle in any way. 2 misoriented edges remain (I
will call it the 2mo state).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Switch 3o + 1mo edges.</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>Adjust the U face so to set the F-cycle or B-cycle to be composed of
3 oriented and 1 misoriented edge.</li>
<li>Turn the cycle set in the last substep, switching orientation of the
edges in the cycle. 4 misoriented edges remain (4mo state).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Switch 4mo edges.</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>Set the 4 remaining misoriented edges in a single cycle, by only
turning the U face around the white-yellow (UB) centers or making U2
around a red-orange (FB) center, so that the edge orientation is
kept.</li>
<li>Turn the cycle composed of the 4 misoriented edges, orienting
them.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how the cycle-setting followed by cycle-turning substeps
closely resembles the light bulb selection followed by light toggling in
the previous simple analogy.</p>
<p>If there are only 2 or 4 misoriented edges in your cube, not 6, you
may just skip to step 2 or step 3 above, respectively, but <em>the order
of the steps is definite</em>. One can demonstrate that the states in
the shortest route to edge orientation (or all lights on) have the
imperative order 6mo ⟶ 2mo ⟶ 4mo ⟶ 0mo by enumerating the few possible
state transitions (Figure 5).</p>
<p><img src="/images/state_transition_graph.svg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> State transition graph of edge orientation
states for LSE. “mo” stands for misoriented edge, and “o” means oriented
edge. Arrow labels indicate the composition of the selected group of
edges to flip. For example, 3o + 1mo means to select 3 oriented and 1
misoriented edge and toggle their orientation. The shortest route to the
goal 0mo state is highlighted in purple. These are the only relevant
transitions, corresponding to the steps described in Procedure 1.</p>
<h3 id="arrow-case-lookahead-from-2mo">2.1. Arrow case lookahead from
2mo</h3>
<p>A relevant property to be noticed is that, after step 2.a, the two
remaining edges outside the set up cycle will necessarily be one
oriented and one misoriented. Pay attention for a moment to two specific
pieces: the single misoriented edge in the cycle you selected (which
will become oriented after turning the cycle) and the remaining oriented
edge outside the selected cycle. <strong>These will be the 2 remaining
oriented edges outside the last cycle, formed in step 3.a.</strong>
Notice that after step 3.a they will necessarily be separated by a blue
or green (F/B) center. By recognizing these two edges early on and
predicting their final position after 3.a, one can lookahead all the
steps following 2.a.</p>
<p>To facilitate the explanation, I will refer to these edges in the
following sections as the <em>in-cycle misoriented (ICM)</em> edge and
the <em>out-cycle oriented (OCO)</em> edge. Remember that ICM and OCO in
the 2mo state will become the only oriented edges in the 4mo (arrow)
state.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The only misoriented edge in the cycle
selected in step 2.a of procedure 1 will be here called <strong>in-cycle
misoriented (ICM)</strong>. The only oriented edge outside this cycle
will be called <strong>out-cycle oriented (OCO)</strong>.</p>
<p>(illustrate the important edges)</p>
<p>Another thought I find useful in this process of looking ahead in
step 2 is that ICM and OCO need to end up one in the U face and the
other in the D face, i.e. one must ensure they are not left in the same
U or D face.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ICM and OCO will end up one in the U face and the other in the D
face.</li>
<li>ICM and OCO will also end up both in the same F or B face, separated
by an F/B center.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="eolr-principles">3. EOLR principles</h2>
<p>Although the Algorithm 1 to orient the LSE is inescapable, there is
some degree of freedom in its steps that can be exploited to skip or
simplify the Roux’s 4b step. This freedom manifests itself in two
ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are usually multiple ways of performing the 2.a and 3.a and
steps, i.e. one can set several cycles that satisfy the edge composition
condition of the steps.</li>
<li>In the cycle turning steps, are arbitrary both
<ol type="a">
<li>the direction (U or U’) in which we choose to turn a cycle after
raising its corresponding center to the U face and</li>
<li>the final choice of an M or M’ move to bring back a white or yellow
center to the top.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The EOLR technique, first proposed by James Straugham (Athefre) and
further developed by Iuri Grangeiro, Kian Mansour and Louis de Mendonça
(see the <a
href="https://www.speedsolving.com/threads/roux-misoriented-centers-table.38176/#post-772850">original
post</a> and <a
href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Roux_method">Speedsolving
wiki</a> ), consists of utilizing this freedom in order to place, during
the edge orientation step (Roux’s 4a), the UR-UL or UF-UB pairs of edges
in the DF and DB positions, where they can easily be inserted to their
correct spots in the U layer, essentially combining Roux’s 4a and 4b in
a single step, i.e. doing 4b while solving 4a.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let’s generically call the original
UR-UL or UF-UB edge pairs by <strong>matching edge pairs</strong> from
here on.</p>
<p>Thus, the goal of EOLR can be stated as placing a matching edge pair
in the DF-DB positions while solving LSE orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> No distinction is made between UR-UL or UF-UB
pairs, so that using the UFUB approach in Roux's 4b is naturally
covered.</p>
<p>If we reverse engineer the solved state, with all edges oriented and
a matching pair at DF-DB, we arrive at only 5 possible edge pair
configurations in the 4mo state that allow for easy insertion at DF-DB
while still solving orientation. And remember that, since 4mo with a
cycle with only misoriented edges (an "arrow") is the mandatory last
step for edge orientation, reaching one of these “good arrows” is
mandatory to solve EOLR.</p>

equivalents obtained by flipping B and F are not represented, but are
just a y2 move apart from the examples. The original UR and UL
(red-yellow and orange-yellow in the figures) are highlighted. In the 2R
and 2L cases, the UL edge is at the DB position. Among the original UR
and UL, which edge is UR and which is UL is not important in the figure,
their positions could be swapped without compromising the diagram’s
meaning.</p>

<p>Reverse engineering one step further, from the 2mo state (step 2 of
Procedure 1), the goal thus becomes achieving not only a 4mo state but a
good 4mo, i.e. a <em>good arrow</em>. And there lies the main objective
here: searching for an intuitive procedure to solve EOLR from 2mo, with
no need for memorization of any specific cases and their corresponding
move sequences.</p>
<h2 id="eolr-with-2-misoriented-edges">4. EOLR with 2 misoriented
edges</h2>
<p>From the 5 good arrow cases (Figure 6) we will concentrate only on
the four first. In all the first four, notice how we always have one of
the two oriented edges pairing with a misoriented one. The two oriented
edges can be predicted from the 2mo state as described in section <a
href="">Arrow case lookahead</a>.</p>
<p>So, besides the in-cycle misoriented (ICM) and the out-cycle oriented
(OCO) edges described in the section, for EOLR, we also want to look for
a third edge that matches up with one of them, so that this third edge
and the ICM or this third edge and the OCO are either the original UL-UR
or the original UF-UB edges.</p>
<p>At this point, the following statement can be made:</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> if there is a third edge pairing up with
either ICM or OCO and if it is adjacent to the ICM in the cycle set up
in the 2a step of Procedure 1, there necessarily is a rotation of this
cycle that leads to a good arrow.</p>
<p>Given its importance, I will call this third edge, being the match-up
with ICM or OCO, misoriented, in-cycle and adjacent to the ICM, by
<strong>MICA</strong>. By “adjacent” in this context, I mean that, if
the cycle is raised to the U face, this edge will not form a straight
line with the ICM and the raised center, forming an “L-shaped”, 90º
angle instead. This is equivalent to saying that the MICA and the ICM
must be connected by one of the arrows illustrated in Figure 4.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> We call <strong>adjacent</strong>
positions in the F-cycle the position pairs UL-UF, UF-UR, UR-DF and
DF-UL. The adjacent positions in the B-cycle are UR-UB, UB-UL, UL-DB and
DB-UR.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> In the 2mo state, an edge that matches
either the ICM or the OCO, is misoriented, in-cycle, and adjacent to the
ICM is called <strong>MICA</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An F/B cycle in the 2mo state that
satisfies the already stated conditions of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Being composed of 3 oriented edges and only one misoriented edge
(the ICM);</li>
<li>Having a MICA.</li>
</ol>
<p>is therefore called a <strong>good cycle</strong> (see Figure 7).</p>
<p><img src="/images/good_cycle1.svg" width="300" /> <img
src="/images/good_cycle2.svg" width="300" /> <img
src="/images/good_cycle3.svg" width="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Three examples of good cycles are
illustrated, with edge colors indicated besides labels and connectors
indicating the MICA and its matching edge, both of which will end up in
the DF and DB positions after EOLR is completed. The solutions to these
and other examples are fully described in the Example solves
appendix.</p>
<p><strong>Set up:</strong></p>
<p>U M U M2 U2 M U2 M' U M' U (Example case 5, first above)</p>
<p>M U' M U' M U M2 U M (Example case 4, second above)</p>
<p>U' M U' M' U' M U M U' M2 (Example case 6, third case above)</p>
<p>Finally, the rotation that turns this good cycle into a good arrow
can be performed as described by Procedure 2, which substitutes step 2
of Procedure 1, specializing it.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 2: converting the 2mo state to a good
arrow.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Set up a good cycle</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Raise the selected good cycle</strong> by performing M' if
it is the F-cycle or M if it is the B-cycle;</li>
<li>Execute a single <strong>U or U’ move</strong> in way that places
either ICM or MICA (whichever is outside the M slice) diagonally
opposite to the OCO (i.e. setting ICM and OCO, or MICA and OCO, to be
separated by the cube's core);</li>
<li>Do an <strong>M or M’ move</strong> in a way that keeps ICM and OCO
in different vertical layers (one in the U layer, the other in the D
layer).</li>
</ol>
<p>After solving the good arrow, the MICA and its matching edge should
arive at DF-DB.</p>
<p>Several examples of application of this procedure are shown in
Section X, with the intention of clarifying any confusion that may
arise.</p>
<h2 id="final-remarks-and-future-work">5. Final remarks and future
work</h2>
<p>Although less frequent, especially if employing UFUB, there are cases
where no good cycle can be formed but a good arrow can still be obtained
with the simple rotation of a cycle. For instance, if the ICM matches
the out-cycle misoriented edge there will be no MICA-ICM pair (see the
following example). However, they can still be paired up in a good arrow
by performing M U M in the example below.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 2mo EOLR unexplained case. - <strong>Set
up:</strong> M U M U M' U M U' M ' U M U' - <strong>Solve:</strong> M U
M (<a
href="https://cubedb.net/?puzzle=3&amp;title=2mo_EOLR_unexplained_case&amp;scramble=MUMUM-UMU-M-UMU-&amp;alg=MUM_%2F%2F_Obtain_a_good_arrow%0AU__%2F%2F_AUF%0AM-_U-_M__%2F%2F_Solve_the_good_arrow">3D
view</a>)</p>
<p>An intuitive explanation is still lacking for those cases, so
expanding or generalizing the proposed procedure should be possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the last "good arrow" case in Figure 6 is not sought by
the proposed procedure, further suggesting eventual extensions.</p>
<p>Additionally, this work is written mainly from a "U/D center on top"
(or “oriented centers”) perspective, so considering what is commonly
called "misoriented centers" poses a new territory to be explored under
the proposed optics (see box X). With F/B on top, turning the
F/B-cycles, which now surround U and D centers, does not toggle their
orientation, and the new goal of 4a seems to be generating 4 misoriented
edges and getting them to the top in order to orient them with an U
move. Employing moves that do not change orientation (U2 and cycle
rotations) seems especially useful to bring edges to the top.</p>
<p>Regarding recognition time, learning each EOLR case separately should
naturally still be faster. However, the proposed framework could be used
as a starting point for this memorization process, with ICM, OCO and
MICA positions becoming progressively more attached to specific move
sequences in "muscle memory".</p>
<p>Finally, some arbitrariness is still present in the described steps
to the 2mo-4mo transition. Namely, there are often multiple good cycles
available to be formed, and the last move of the cycle rotation (M or
M') can be arbitrarily chosen in the cases where ICM and OCO are the
diagonally opposite edges of step X.</p>
<p>Future proposals could further restrict this freedom in order to go
beyond 4b, worrying about "good 4c" cases even before 4a. Therefore, I
hope the ideas on the present work can contribute with the understanding
of the last six edges behaviour, and perhaps sparkle further
contributions that could open the doors to one-look LSE.</p>
